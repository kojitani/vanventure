          body: 'The camper was very nice and just as described. We requested delivery and setup and when we arrived, it was setup and ready for us to move in for our weekend getaway. It had adequate space for of our supplies we brought during our stay. The air conditioner works very well and stayed very cool and pleasant throughout the day and night. The beds are a little harder than I’m use to, so may want to bring some form of memory foam mattress for personal comfort. Dan contacted us the day we arrived to be sure everything was to our liking and made sure we knew he was available if any issues were to arise with the camper. Overall, we had an excellent time and so enjoyed the use of the pop-up camper. I would definitely reach out to Dan again for another trip down the road.',
